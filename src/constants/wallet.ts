			`Cryptocurrency <a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/wallet">Wallet</a>  are software programs that store private and public keys and interface with various blockchain to enable users to send and receive digital currency and monitor their balance. It is the equivalent of a bank account where you can both deposit and withdraw funds from (though only the latter with cryptocurrency).`,
			`Cryptocurrency wallets store private and public keys and facilitate the sending and receiving of digital currency and monitor all transactions to protect from identity theft. The private key is used to authorize payments, while the public key is used to access received funds.`,
			`Cryptocurrency wallets can be hot, meaning that they are connected to the internet, or cold, meaning that they have no internet connection. When deciding whether to use a  <a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/wallets/"> hot wallet vs a cold wallet </a>, you need to consider several factors: while hot wallets are often more user friendly, they also carry a higher risk of loss of funds due to their internet connection.`

It is also possible to send cryptocurrency to this address if it is generated with a genuine random number generator (RNG).`,
			`They are simple, secure and offline alternatives to digital cryptocurrency wallets. They have all of the benefits of paper money while also providing the unique ability to securely cold-store digital currency without any possibility of a hacker or malware gaining access to your funds.`
